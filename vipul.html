        <h1>VIPUL PAL </h1>
        <p>Every day, he collected shells, but he never found a pearl
One day, tired and disappointed, he said:</p>
<hr>
<h1>Education</h1>
<hr>
<p>Maybe I’m just not lucky
An old fisherman sitting nearby smiled and asked,
How many times have you tried.</p>
<p>The boy replied,
Only a few days
The fisherman looked at the ocean and said,</p>
<hr>
<h1>Experience</h1>
<hr>
<p>Do you know who finds pearls
The one who is not afraid of the deep.
Standing on the shore, no one ever finds a pearl</p>
<hr>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>The boy thought about his words.
The next morning, he went deeper into the water.
He slipped,fell, struggled…
but he kept going.</p>
<p>And one bright morning—
a shining pearl was in his hand.

The boy shouted with joy,I did it
The fisherman nodded and said,
See A pearl always belongs to the one
who tries one more time before giving up.”</p>
